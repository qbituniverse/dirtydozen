# XII. No focus on clean code

## That's why ditrydozen.dev is here

You have finally reached chapter 12th of the [ditrydozen.dev](/) list of the `12` most `dirty` and `common` code mistakes programmers tend to make over and over again.

All of the mistakes described on this website stem from `one and only one underlying cause`, which is:

> No focus on clean code

## Problem Statement

If programmers don't understand the potential `pitfalls` of `bad coding standards` then we'll just keep seeing repeats of the same mistakes.

Of course, you always need to consider the `context` under which code was written. Perhaps some `bad patterns` were introduced with an intention to `pay them off` at later stage - we also know this as [Technical Debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt).

Furthermore, some of the `ditrydozen.dev` mistakes are more `severe` than others. Likewise, certain `code smells` appear in code more often than others. At the end of the day, it's a fine balance between `speed of delivery vs code quality`. 

> The `best programmers` in the field will constantly `learn` and `improve` their coding standards and patterns, which in turn will manifest itself in `code quality`. With time, their code quality and experience will improve and that in turn will feed into efficiency and `speed of delivery`.

## Solution

Just keep an eye on these `code smells`. There are tools out there, such as [ReSharper for C#](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) or [IntelliJ IDEA for Java](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), both from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/).

For multi-language static code analysis you can try [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) or reference this [List of tools for static code analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tools_for_static_code_analysis).

Finally, clean and structured code is just one thing to bear in mind. `Smelly code` has the bad tendency of exposing your application to [Cyberattacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack) which can potentially damage your career progression as well as your organisation. [OWASP](https://owasp.org/) is a non-profit foundation which works on [improving the security of software](https://owasp.org/www-community/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools). I strongly suggest to explore it in addition to the [ditrydozen.dev](/) resources.

## Summary

Stay focused and `abreast of new technologies`, keep `learning and improving` your own standards, maybe even contribute to these with your own ideas and also `share your knowledge` with others.

> Understand the implications your code can bring and above all `focus on clean code`, `enjoy coding` and `stay safe` :)
